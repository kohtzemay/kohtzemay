                    hi there! my name's Megan, and i'm a junior in college majoring in Computer Science
                    and minoring in Japanese. welcome to my little corner of the interwebz, where things
                    get pretty personal but where i try to end on a high note. because what's life
                    without a little drama, right?
                </p>

                <h2>The Girl</h2>

                <p>
                    when i'm not getting my ass kicked by college, i enjoy reading, movies, geeking out
                    about stuff, chilling with my mates, and catching a probably unnecessary snooze. i'm a
                    huuuuge foodie and always down to try new cuisines. weirdest thing i've eaten? it's a tie
                    between frog and raw herring. they sound grosser than they really are, i promise. watch
                    me carb my way through life.
                </p>

                    Some random facts about me:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>I've read the <i>Harry Potter</i> series more than seven times over</li>
                    <li>Chocolate is my weakness</li>
                    <li>I'm an animal person, but dogs have a special place in my heart</li>
                    <li>I've visited 14 countries</li>
                    <li>I'm an extroverted introvert: I'm outgoing among introverts, but shy among extroverts</li>
                    <li>One of my biggest dreams is to visit outer space</li>
                </ol>

                    what does the name <b>kohtzemay</b> mean, you ask? i wanted a name that was both personal
                    and original for this site â€” and what better name to use than my own? i am ethnically
                    Chinese, so although Megan is my given name, i also have a Chinese name: <i>Koh Tze May</i>.
                    and therein lay the answer to my everlong quest of a site name i would be satisfied with
                    for longer than 2 seconds.
                </p>

                    i've been blogging on-and-off for around five years now (dang, that's a long time),
                    and i just can't seem to stay away from it. i'm currently doing a semester abroad in York,
                    England, so you'll get to read glimpses of that. basically, think of this as an online
                    journal without a properly functioning filter, because that's what it's going to be.
