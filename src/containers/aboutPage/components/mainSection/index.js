                    Hi there! My name’s Megan, and I’m a junior in college studying Computer Science
                    and minoring in Japanese. If this blog didn’t already tell you, I’m a huge nerd and
                    fangirl and also a lover of monochrome. I live life in black and white.

                    I’ve been blogging on-and-off for around 5 years—or whenever I decide not to
                    get my ass kicked by college anymore. I’ve blogged about books, movies, anime, video
                    games (like I said: huge nerd), but never had a blog/website that was more personal
                    and that focused more on other passions, or showcased the design/development work
                    I’ve done over the years. That’s what this blog is.
                </p>

                    As I mentioned above, I’ve done design and development work for websites for a
                    while now; I’m a self-taught web developer and designer. This website was designed
                    and developed by yours truly. Design and development have been a huge part of my
                    life, and definitely something I enjoy doing, so to be able to work on your site
                    would be a great pleasure!
                </p>

                    This is mekoh, a personal blog and portfolio, where all my different interests
                    come together in one big elegant mess! Here, you’ll see posts about my personal
                    life, what’s currently on my mind, music, books, and a lot of other things.

                    Interested in getting to know more about my work and what I do? You can visit
                    my portfolio to see the sites I’ve designed in the past. If those catch your eye,
                    you can hire me to design and develop your own space!
