                    Now that we have a good idea of the direction to take your website in, I can
                    start coming up with the initial design! This step starts out with a
                    "moodboard," which is a sort of guideline for the styles in the design,
                    before I design the actual layout.
                </p>
            </div>
        );
    }

}

export default Tile2;
